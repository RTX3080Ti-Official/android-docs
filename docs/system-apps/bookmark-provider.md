# Bookmark Provider
**Bookmark Provider** is an appp introduced in old Android versions, it still exists today for compatibility reasons. It's package name is ``com.android.bookmarkprovider``.

:::note

This page is gonna reference the functions in old Addroid versions.

## Functions
This app was a centralized bookmark storage so different browsers can access the same bookmarks.

This is now useless since browsers decided to implement their own bookmark system.

:::tip

If you don't use apps targeting an old SDK, it is probably safe to remove.
