# Dynamic System Updates
**Dynamic System Updates** (or DSU for short) is an **hidden** option in **Developer Options**. It's package name is ``com.android.dynsystem``.

## Functions
It allows you to load GSI (Generic System Image) install, this is great if you want to test another ROM without interfering with your current installation.

:::note

This feature isn't supported on every device.

:::

## What happens if I try to load a GSI install if my device isn't supported?
Nothing will happen, you will get a Verification Dialog (``.VerificationActivity``) but nothing will happen, probably the app crashes when trying to run/load the GSI.
