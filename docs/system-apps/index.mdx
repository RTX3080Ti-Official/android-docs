# System Apps
A system app in Android is an application you cannot remove normally (e.g. without root.)

:::note

{/* if contributing and using another rom please update this list */}
Some apps are **vendor-specific**, which means some apps may not be on a ROM but will be on another. Currently this category uses **LineageOS**.

:::

System apps certificates are from the vendor (e.g. AOSP uses default Android certificates, Xiaomi uses Xiaomi certificates.)
